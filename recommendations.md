## How to Get a Saskatoon Library Card

Getting a library card in Saskatoon is easy and opens up free access to thousands of books, audiobooks, tools, and workshops — perfect for lifelong learners and budget-friendly living.

1. **Visit any Saskatoon Public Library branch** — You’ll need a piece of ID and proof of Saskatoon residency (like a driver’s license or utility bill).
2. **Sign up in person or online** — You can start the process online at [saskatoonlibrary.ca](https://saskatoonlibrary.ca) and finish it at a branch.
3. **Start borrowing** — You’ll get access to physical books, ebooks (with Libby app), audiobooks, streaming services (like Kanopy), and free events.

I love the library, I use it to borrow books, movies, and even PS5 games!

## My Favourite Local Stores in Saskatoon

I love supporting local shops that have high-quality, buy-it-for-life products. Here are a few of my favourites:

- **Outter Limits** — An outdoor store that’s perfect for hiking, camping, and Saskatchewan adventures.
- **Escape Sports** — A locally owned shop for people who love to get outside. They specialize in gear for paddleboarding, longboarding, disc golf, camping, and commuting by bike or skateboard. A perfect stop if you want to add a little more adventure and movement to your lifestyle. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly.
