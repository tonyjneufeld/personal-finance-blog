## Meet Tony

Hi, I'm Tony Neufeld. My goal is to become a personal finance and lifestyle design coach in Saskatchewan, Canada.

My journey started like many Canadian professionals — with student loans, big dreams, and the nagging question of whether I could truly build wealth while still enjoying my life in my 20s.

Through careful planning, intentional lifestyle design, and some unconventional choices, my wife and I reached our financial goals much earlier than we thought possible in Saskatchewan.

Now, I want to help other people in Saskatchewan build their own paths to financial freedom while creating lives they don't need to escape from.

### Financial Independence

Financial independence** isn't just about the money — it's about creating freedom to live your ideal lifestyle. It's about building systems and habits that grow your net worth while still enjoying your life now. My approach focuses on optimizing the big decisions that really move the needle, rather than cutting out every small pleasure.

- Intentional spending that aligns with values
- Strategic career growth and income expansion
- Optimized Canadian tax strategies
- Long-term wealth building
- Building your ideal lifestyle plan

### Lifestyle Design

A life well-lived requires intention. This means designing your career and lifestyle around what truly matters to you. My approach will help you identify your core values and create systems that align your time, energy, and money with those priorities.

- Discovering your personal definition of "enough"
- Creating space for deep work
- Building a career that leverages your strengths
- Being present and engaged in all stages of life
- Making decisions from a place of intention, not obligation
