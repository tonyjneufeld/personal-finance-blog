title:  "What I Actually Do in a Week (And Why I’m Writing About It)"
---

The purpose of this blog is to be an open place where I can write about literally anything. And that excites me. I am a Myers-Briggs ENFP, and that means I will constantly be finding new interests and new things to do with life. It also means that I love learning from real people about their interests and what makes them tick. At the end of the day, I am who I am. I believe writing this blog will help me be the best version of myself and can eventually help others be the best versions of themselves. 

So, since we are very early days of this blog, I want to write about what my interests are today as I look ahead to my 30s. First, I have to share who I was in my 20s. Since, over the years, I have tried to be many different people. I have tried to be a YouTuber, a personal finance influencer, an animal TikToker, an Engineer, a disc golfer, a gardener, a golfer, a travel vlogger, an entrepreneur, a guitar player, a solopreneur, a skateboarder, a digital minimalist, a minimalist, a hockey player, and many, many other random endeavours. 

Every little thing you spend your time on is a vote towards who you are, so who am I right now? When I think about what I actually spent my time on last week, I actually have to laugh a little:

* I work 40 hours a week as a Senior Manager of Revenue Compensation and Operations at a survey software company. I studied Mechanical Engineering, so I will have to share how I got here sometime.   
* I am training for a 10km run in a few weeks, so I ran 23km with my dog last week.  
* I spent some time reading the third book of Game of Thrones (Storm of Swords). I have seen the show, so I am so afraid for what is coming (ehemmm, Red Wedding).  
* I played probably 4 hours of Apex Legends, and Last of Us Part 2 (playing along while watching the show is so fun\!).  
* I spent about 4 hours working on a birth class with my beautiful wife (Only three months till baby).  
* I played three rounds of disc golf.  
* I worked on this blog for about three hours. I also wrote an email to SaskMoney.ca to see how I could get involved and help them.  
* I read about and worked on my yard for about five hours, dethatching and learning about how to overseed properly (it makes me think that I need a log for my lawn).

I laugh because it is such a random smorgasbord of things. But when I reflect on this list, I am grateful for the flexibility and time I currently have in life. I know things will never be the same in about three months. Reflecting on my 20s and who I am today makes me look forward to my 30s, when things will change dramatically. 

So why do I want to write in my 30s? I believe this blog will give me a sustainable place to share and grow as I continue to change. And there are a multitude of other reasons. One reason is that with the advent of AI, it is incredibly easy to go to any of the many chatbots, plug in a half-baked prompt, get what you are looking for, and move on with your day. I believe that actually writing will help me continue to not only nurture my writing skills but also improve them. I believe that sharing stories is the best way to learn, and this is where all of the AI-generated things miss the mark; they aren’t real people talking about real things. Real stories from real people can help you implement real, lasting changes in your life.

I will expand on that last point in future posts, but for now, blog post \#2 is complete. Thanks for reading. And I look forward to sharing stories from real people\!
